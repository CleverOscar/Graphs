## Graphs Problem Solving
### Translate the problem
#### Nodes: People
##### Edges: When a child has a parent


### Build our graph or define our get_neighbors

### Choose an algorithm
#### Either BFS or DFS
#### DFS
#### How would we know if DFS is happened to be faster?
####
#### 
def earliest_ancestor(ancestors, starting_node):
    pass
